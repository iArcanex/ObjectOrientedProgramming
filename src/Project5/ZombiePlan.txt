Zombie Project - Plan and PseudoCode

25 healthy, well-armed, fed students survive a zombie attack in the CBT for 10 days

Classes:
Apocalypse - Program logic and loops for the events
Main - Has object Apocalypse and runs simulation, won't do too much other than that
Person - Logic of the person and their qualities. Ammo, food, mechanics?, etc
Utilities - Constants, static methods, messages, things to utilize that would be repreated often

Required foundation: (80%)
1) One person needs to survive 10 nights to win
2) Each person has a gun and 150 ammo
3) Enough food for 8 people to survive for 10 days (1 food = 1 person, 80 food = 8 people fed for 10 days)
4) Random number of zombies from 10 to 50 will get in at night
5) Zombies have to be destroyed every night
6) Fight with either gun or blunt object
7) gun has 1/5 accuracy. If hit 1/3 chance of insta, otherwise must hit at least twice to kill. Miss is 50% for person to go down by 1
8) blunt object has 1/3 accuracy. If hit 1/10 of insta, otherwise must hit three times to kill. Miss means death
9) IF ammo > 0 then gun, otherwise use blunt object

To get a (100%)
1) Balance so a person lives in the 10 days [YES]
OR) allow people to leave CBT to get resources [MAYBE]
OR) Make graphics [WON'T DO]

Required programming constructs:
1) Scanner for input
2) Println()
3) If/Else
4) Class for person, simulator, and Project8.test
5) Methods in the right classes
6) Counter variable (prob for loops to count with limits)
7) Constants (FINAL)
8) Sentinel Loop (While something is true, do this)
9) Count controller (For every x, do this)
10) Methods with params (testMethod(int x))
11) Constructor (Class constructor)
12) toString() for each class
13) Clear outputs and comments
14) Well structures code (instanced data, constructor, and methods after)
15) Do whatever you want
